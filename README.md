ABSTRACT



I have used React that is the best library for UI development for the frontend part and NodeJS, ExpressJs for the backend part. For database, I am going to use MongoDB that is document-oriented database and stores data in BSON (JSON) format. 


I have built a web application pertaining where users can save their memories of their trips. My website will be built using web languages and frameworks. It will provide an interface to the users that provide them to easily save their precious moments in card format. 


In this application, every user can see other userâ€™s memories that allow other users to know more about different places and get correct feedbacks about these places. Users can also like each other posts and also able to see the date of creation. 


This application that I have built using front-end as well as back-end web   technologies and I have provided a user-friendly interface so that users get never stuck.
